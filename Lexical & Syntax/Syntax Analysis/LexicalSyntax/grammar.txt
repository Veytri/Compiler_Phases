# Definition of the grammar rules for a simple programming language

# Program consists of zero or more statements
Program: Stmt*

# Statement is defined as an additive expression
Stmt: AdditiveExpr

# Additive expression is composed of multiplicative expressions
# with optional + or - operators in between
AdditiveExpr: MultiplicativeExpr((PLUS | MINUS) MultiplicativeExpr)

# Multiplicative expression is composed of factors with optional
# multiplication or division operators in between
MultiplicativeExpr: Factor((MUL | DIV) Factor)*

# Factor is defined as an integer 
# or AdditiveExpr with open and close parenthesis
Factor: INTEGER
